## Preparation of props.csv file from calculation results

### Working Environment
To set up the required environment, run:  
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Reproducing Data Extraction
To generate a `.csv` file with molecular properties, use:  
```bash
./props_to_csv.sh data > props_raw.csv
```
```bash
python process_csv.py props_raw.csv props.csv
```

**Note:** The script expects the first two parts of the dataset, `PACHQA1-main.7z` and `PACHQA2-full_outfiles.7z`, to be extracted into a common directory, e.g., `data`.

Extraction commands:
```bash
7z x PACHQA1-main.7z -odata
7z x PACHQA2-full_outfiles.7z -odata
```
